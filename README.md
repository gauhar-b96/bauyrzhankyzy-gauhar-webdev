Introduction:

I am completing my last undergraduate semester at Northeastern University. 
My major is Economics and Mathematics, and I also have a minor in Computer 
Science. I do not have any experience in programming besides the two 
fundamental courses. My past working experience includes two Co-ops in 
finance-related industries.

Purpose:

The purpose of the current repository is to keep track of the code that I wrote for 
the Web Development course (CS 4550). The repository would contain codes for 
6 assignments and the project. Links to the project and assignments are provided 
below.
