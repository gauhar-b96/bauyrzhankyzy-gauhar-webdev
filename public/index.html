    <h2><span class="s1"><b>About Me</b></span></h2>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">My name is Gauhar, and I am from Kazakhstan.
  I just graduated from Northeastern University, majoring in Economics and Mathematics
  with a minor in Computer Science. I am planning on working full-time for several years,
  and then applying for a graduate school. Currently, I am thinking of doing two masters programs,
  one of them being Business Administration and the other one being Computer Science.</span></p>

              <h2><span class="s1"><b>Web Development Course</b></span></h2>
              <p class="p2"><span class="s1">During my last semester at Northeastern,
    I was taking Web Development course, in which we learnt how to build web applications
    from the scratch. We were using different languages and tools such as AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB,
    HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, SQL, and RESTful Web services. In case you are interested,
    you can see application of the above on my <a href="assignment/login">assignment page</a>.</span></p>

            <h2><span class="s1"><b>Project - Poetry Paradise</b></span></h2>
            <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Besides working on weekly assignments, we had to come up with our
            own project and build the web application for it. I enjoy composing poems, but since it is such
            an “old-fashioned” thing to do and the community of poets is so small, there are not that many
            online resources to publish my work for those who would appreciate it. That is how the idea
            for the <i><a href="https://poetryparadise.herokuapp.com">Poetry Paradise</a></i> was born.</span></p>
