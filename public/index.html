    <h1> Welcome to Gauhar's Home Page!</h1>
    <h2><span class="s1"><b>About Me</b></span></h2>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">My name is Gauhar, and I am from Kazakhstan.
  I just graduated from Northeastern University with a major in Economics and Mathematics
  and a minor in Computer Science. My post-graduation plan is to work full-time for several years,
  and then apply for a graduate school. Currently, I am thinking of doing two masters programs,
  one of them being in Business Administration and the other one being in Computer Science.</span></p>

        <h2><span class="s1"><b>Web Development Course</b></span></h2>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">During my last semester at Northeastern,
    I was taking Web Development course, in which we learnt how to build web applications
    from scratch. To do so, we were using different languages and tools such as AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB,
    HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, SQL, and RESTful Web services. In case you are interested,
    you can see application of the above on my <a href="assignment/#!/login">Assignment Page</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">You could also test the MongoDB by clicking on the following
          <a href="test/index.html">Test MongoDB</a>.</span></p>

        <h2><span class="s1"><b>Project - Poetry Paradise</b></span></h2>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Besides working on weekly assignments, we had to come up with our
            own project and build the web application for it. I enjoy composing poems, but since it is such
            an “old-fashioned” thing to do and the community of modern poets is so small, there are not that many
            online resources to publish my work for those who would appreciate it. That is how the idea
            for the <i><a href="https://poetryparadise.herokuapp.com">Poetry Paradise</a></i> was born.</span>
          Poetry Paradise is a web platform that not only allows access to published poetry, but also gives
          users the ability to post their own compositions, receive feedback, edit masterpieces in progress,
          translate poems, or simply enjoy reading pieces of art from talented people around the globe.</p>
